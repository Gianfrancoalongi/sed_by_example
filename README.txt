This is an inductive self-study package that assumes you go through the scripts 
one by one by looking at them, reasoning aboute them and executing them.

         chmod a+x *.bash
         ...
         cat the_script.bash
         ./the_script.bash

There is an intended folder order, but no specific intended order within the
folders. You should go through the folders in the following order

	  sed_scripts
          misc
